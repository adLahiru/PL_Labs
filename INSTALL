Instructions on installing and compiling the TWS.

1.  Download the TWS into the directory of your choice.
    The link is on the Announcements page.

2.  Execute:

	  %gunzip tws.tar.gz
	  %tar xvf tws.tar
	  %cd tws

3.  Read the README file.  

4.  Compile the entire TWS system, including the Tiny compiler:

	 %make

5.  In the future, to re-compile the Tiny compiler,  run 'make'
     while in the 'tiny' directory.
    
6. To test the Tiny Compiler/Interpreter:

	 %./tc tests/p1   +   Seven test programs.  It is strongly
	 %./tc tests/p2   |   suggested you take a look at %these test
	 %./tc tests/p3   |   programs.  Your first assignment 
	 %./tc tests/p4   |   (Project 0) consists of writing an 
	 %./tc tests/p5   |   eighth Tiny program, to become %familiar
	 %./tc tests/p6   |   with the language and the %compiler.
	 %./tc tests/p7   +
