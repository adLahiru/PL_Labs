Dear CS3513 Student:

    Welcome to fifteen weeks of torture !!  We will try to make
    sure this course is comparable to taking a drink of water
    from a firehose.  So, brace yourselves for lots of material.

Here are some instructions on getting started with the tws system:

1.  Go to your home directory.
2.  Download and unzip the tws file given in the Moodle.

3.  To compile the Tiny compiler (while in your tiny directory):

	 %make

This will cause various commands to be performed:

       {compilation of your Constrainer.c}
       {compilation of your CodeGenerator.c}
       {compilation of lex.tiny into lex.yy.c}
       {compilation of lex.yy.c into lex.yy.o}
       {compilation parse.tiny into code.y}
       {compilation of code.y into y.tab.c}
       {comnpilation of y.tab.c into y.tab.o}
       {loading of y.tab.o and lex.yy.o into parse}

To test the Tiny Compiler/Interpreter:

	 %tc tests/p1   +   Seven test programs.  It is strongly
	 %tc tests/p2   |   suggested you take a look at these test
	 %tc tests/p3   |   programs.  Your first assignment
	 %tc tests/p4   |   consists of writing an eighth Tiny
	 %tc tests/p5   |   program, to become familiar with the
	 %tc tests/p6   |   language and the compiler.
	 %tc tests/p7   +   

To test the interpreter alone:

	 %cd tests
	 %~/tws/bin/interpret

---------------
GOOD LUCK !!
